    "# Notes\n",
    "- **dictionary** like a list but more general. mapping between set of indices (keys) and a set of values. Key maps to value and the association is called a **key-value pair** or an **item**\n",
    "- function **dict** creates new dictionary with no items. {} represents empty dictionary\n",
    "- to add items to dictionary use dictionaryname[key] = value; or dictionaryname = {key: value, etc.)\n",
    "- order of items in dictionary is unpredictable\n",
    "- len(dictionaryname) gives you numberof key-value pairs\n",
    "- in operator works if key appears in dictionary, not if value appears\n",
    "- dictionaryname.values returns values as a list\n",
    "- **hashtable** algorithm used for in operator to take same amount of time no matter how many items in dictionary.\n",
    "- **implementation** way of performing a computation\n",
    "- **histogram** statistical term for set of counters/frequecies\n",
    "- dictionaryname.get(key, default value) if key appears in dictionary, get returns vaue, if not in dictionary, returns default value\n",
    "- for loop in dictionary only traverses keys\n",
    "- dictionaryname.keys returns keys of dictionary as a list\n",
    "- **lookup** operation where you find corresponding value given dictionary and key\n",
    "- **raise** statement causes an exception ex raise ValueError(optional detailed message)\n",
    "- **singleton** list with single element\n",
    "- **hash** fuction that takes a value and returns a integer.\n",
    "- **call graph** set of cunction frames\n",
    "- **memo** previously computed value stored for later\n",
    "- variables created outside function belong to frame called **__main__**. sometimes called **global** bc can be accessed from any function, un like local variables\n",
    "- **flags** boolean variablle that indicates whether conditon is true\n",
    "- to reassign global variable in function, need to **declare** global variable ie. 'global variablename' in function\n",
    "- **tuple** sequence of values, immutable lists, comma-separated list of values\n",
    "- tuple with single element is created by tuplename = 'value', (need the comma at the end!)\n",
    "- can create tuple using tuple(elements)\n",
    "- cannot modify elements of tuple but can replace tuple with another\n",
    "- **tuple assignment**: a,b = b,a\n",
    "- divmod() takes in tw arguments and returns quotient and remainder. can store as a tuple\n",
    "- ** function with parameter that starts with * gathers arguments into tuple ** \n",
    "- opposite of gather is **scatter** where you want to pass sequence of values into function as multiple arguments\n",
    "- **zip()** takes two or more sequences and zips into a list of tuples\n",
    "- dictionary.items() returns list of key-value pairs as tuples\n",
    "- can use tuples to initialize a dictionary\n",
    "- .update also works to take a list of tuples and add to dictionary\n",
    "- sort function DSU\n",
    "    - **Decorate** a sequence by building a list of tuples with one or more sort keys preceding the elements from the sequence,\n",
    "    - **Sort** the list of tuples, and\n",
    "    - **Undecorate** by extracting the sorted elements of the sequence.\n",
    "- strings more limited because elements have to be characters also immutable\n",
    "- lists are more common than tuples because they are mutable\n",
    "- syntatically simpler to create tuple sometimes\n",
    "- if using sequence as dictionary key, need to use immutable type (tuple or string)\n",
    "- using tuples reduce potential for unexpected behavior due to aliasing.\n",
    "- use sorted() and reversed() tp take any sequence as a parameter and return a new list with same elements in different order"
